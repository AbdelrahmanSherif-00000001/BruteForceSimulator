This is a Brute-Force Simulator I forked from: https://github.com/shreyaskbkukke
After trying and testing it, I saw I could enhance it and add some improvements, So I ddid the following :

1.Improved the UI. 
2.Updated the code to use modern C++ libraries and functions so it works better on today's devices.
3.Fixed some issues in the logic of Case 3 ("Start Brute Force") that I faced during trying.
